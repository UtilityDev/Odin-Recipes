        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Blend roasted broccoli, cream cheese, and vegetable broth to make a simple, yet delicious soup. Roasting broccoli enhances its flavor, allowing nutty and sweet flavors to develop.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups chopped broccoli florets and stalks</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>Â¾ teaspoon lemon pepper, or more as needed</li>
            <li>crushed red pepper flakes to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up lumps, until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.</li>
            <li>Add tomato sauce, chili beans, and chili seasoning mix to saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, at least 10 minutes to let flavors meld.</li>
            <li>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop potato pulp into large bowl. (You should have about 4 cups pulp). Discard skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a light roux, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time. Cook, whisking constantly, until lightly thickened. Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes (soup will be very thick). Remove from heat and gradually stir in 1 cup cheese.</li>
            <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with chili, sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and chives (if using).</li>
        </ol>
